<ur></ur>
Home page is fully responsive but remaining pages are not responsive yet , those pages are might not be properly visible on small screen devices.

<h1>End Notes</h1>
<ur></ur>
In this project we have tried to a perfect clone of the original website as much as possible with very limited knowledge of front-end & back-end. This entire journey of making the project was awesome. We learned lots of things by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot of confidence.
